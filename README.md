# React Native Unique ID Generation with Oracle DB

This project is a **React Native** app that generates **unique IDs** and integrates with **Oracle Database**. The app provides a solution for creating and storing unique identifiers for various purposes, such as user IDs or object IDs, leveraging Oracle DB for persistence and backend operations.

## Features

- **React Native** for cross-platform app development.
- Unique ID generation for users or objects.
- **Oracle Database** integration for secure data storage.
- REST API to interact with the backend database.
- Easy-to-use UI for generating, viewing, and managing unique IDs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-native-unique-id-oracle-db.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native-unique-id-oracle-db
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Install CocoaPods dependencies (for iOS only):

   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

## Usage

### Running the App

- For **iOS**:

  ```bash
  npx react-native run-ios
  ```

- For **Android**:

  ```bash
  npx react-native run-android
  ```

Make sure the emulator or physical device is set up and running.

### Backend Server

1. Set up your Oracle DB by following the [Setup Oracle Database](#setup-oracle-database) section.
2. Run the backend server by navigating to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

## Technologies

- **React Native**: JavaScript framework for writing natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.
- **Oracle DB**: A robust relational database management system used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Express.js**: For building the backend API to communicate with Oracle DB.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for server-side code execution.

## Setup Oracle Database

1. Install the Oracle Instant Client for your operating system.
2. Install the Oracle node driver:

   ```bash
   npm install oracledb
   ```

3. Configure your Oracle DB credentials in the `config/db.js` file:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     user: 'your_oracle_db_username',
     password: 'your_oracle_db_password',
     connectString: 'your_oracle_db_connection_string'
   };
   ```

4. Create the necessary tables in your Oracle DB for storing unique IDs:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE unique_ids (
     id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
     unique_id VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

5. Run your backend server to interact with the database.

## API Endpoints

Here are the API endpoints available for interaction with the Oracle database:

- **Generate Unique ID**: `POST /api/generate-id`
  - Generates and stores a unique ID in the Oracle DB.

- **Get All IDs**: `GET /api/ids`
  - Retrieves all the unique IDs stored in the database.

- **Delete ID**: `DELETE /api/ids/:id`
  - Deletes a specific ID from the Oracle DB.
